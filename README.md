# odin-recipes
I will be creating a website to demonstrate what I have learned in the HTML lesson. 
The website will include multiple recipes that can be read by clinking on links that will take you to a different part of the website. 
There will be photos showing what you will be making.
At the end of the project I will have demonstrated my knowlege of how to create a website that includes links, photos, and different types of text.
